# Project--2


üìò Week 2 - Java mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini Java projects built during my second week of learning. These projects are focused on reinforcing core concepts in recursion, backtracking, and sorting, with hands-on problem-solving through both homework and advanced questions.

üîç Projects Overview
1Ô∏è‚É£ Sorting Visualizer
*A command-line simulation of the Bubble Sort algorithm to understand step-by-step sorting mechanics.

*Concepts Covered:

*Bubble Sort logic

*Array manipulation

*Iterative problem-solving

*Console-based visualization for learning

2Ô∏è‚É£ Recursive Math Toolbox
*A menu-driven program to perform:

*Factorial calculation

*Fibonacci series generation

*Power computation (a^b)

*GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

~Concepts Covered:

*Recursion base and recursive cases

*Stack behavior in recursive functions

*Multiple use-case logic in a single recursive framework

3Ô∏è‚É£ Sudoku Solver
*A classic backtracking problem where a 9x9 Sudoku board is solved using recursion and constraint-checking.

*Concepts Covered:

*Backtracking strategy

*Safety checks in constraints (row, column, 3x3 grid)

*Efficient traversal and backtrack correction

4Ô∏è‚É£ N-Queens
*This project handles backtracking problem such as:

üîπ N-Queens Solver
*Solves the N-Queens problem using a recursive board placement strategy ensuring no queens threaten each other.

*Concepts Covered:

*Backtracking template design

*Constraint satisfaction

*Board manipulation and validation

üí° Learning Goals & Outcome
*Strengthened core DSA concepts like recursion, backtracking, and sorting.

*Practiced both homework-level and advanced questions to solidify understanding.

*Applied learning to real-world problem formats like Sudoku and N-Queens.

*Wrote modular, structured, and testable code using Java best practices.

üìÅ How to Run
*Compile and run the JavaProjectsRunner.java file.

*Follow the console menu to test each individual mini-project.

*Each project is interactive and allows for custom input where applicable.
